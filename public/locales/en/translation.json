  "intro": "a front-end developer focused on building scalable and maintainable web interfaces. I mostly work with React and Next.js, and I care deeply about clean architecture, performance, and a good developer experience. My goal is to bridge design and engineering by crafting UI that’s both intuitive and technically sound.",

  "childhood": {
    "title": "Childhood",
    "paragraph": "My childhood was full of simple games and a quiet curiosity. I used to love puzzles—not just for fun, but because I wanted to understand how things fit together. I spent a lot of time playing with my cousins, creating our own little worlds. My dad encouraged me with small, confident words. My mom was always gently present, paying attention in ways I didn’t fully realize at the time. Looking back, I see how much of who I am was quietly built during those years."

  "adolescence": {
    "title": "Adolescence",
    "paragraph": "In my teens, I spent most of my time reading books and watching films. Real life often felt distant, but stories made sense to me. I was the kind of kid who thought a lot, asked quiet questions. School wasn’t just about grades—I saw it as a way to figure out who I was and how the world worked. I might’ve seemed quiet on the outside, but inside, my thoughts were always moving."
  },
  "university": {
    "title": "University",
    "paragraph": "University brought a turn I didn’t expect. I never planned to go into programming—had no background, no big goal. But somehow, that’s where I ended up. I started from scratch and slowly found my way. I became one of the top students, not just because of grades, but because I really wanted to understand. Most of what I learned came from outside the classroom—from trying, failing, figuring things out on my own."
  },
  "now": {
    "title": "Now",
    "paragraph": "Now, I work as a developer. Every day brings new problems to solve, and I’m still learning. It’s not always easy—some days are exhausting—but the feeling of progress and growth is something I really value. When I look back at how it all unfolded, I realize nothing was random. Every step, even the uncertain ones, helped shape who I’ve become."

She is truly intrinsically motivated by her goals and values, and she stays focused regardless of external pressures or distractions.
